In order to assist companies looking to <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?whatisafundinground%3F=&utm_source=website+-+blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=glossary+link+for+the+word+funding+round"" id="""">fundraise </a>small amounts or struggling to find an investor, it became an effective solution. The SAFE method defines that an investor can fund a company and in return receive shares at a later, predetermined event or time. However, the conditions vary, commonly SAFE is triggered when a company goes through a process that <a href=""https://altshare.com/409a-valuation/?utm_source=website+-+blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=glossary+link+for+the+word+validates+its+value"" id="""">validates its value</a> (a company’s fair market value valuation or funding round for example).</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">SAFE allows a founder to receive an investment without labeling a value to the company shares. When it's finally time for the investor to receive his shares, a calculating method will be activated. As each case will provide different revenue for the investor, the method of calculation will change according to the profitability of each method.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Although SAFE is considered to be a convertible loan, it holds an important difference: SAFE usually does not accumulate interest. The time that has passed from signing the SAFE until its activation shouldn't affect the deal one bit.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">How does SAFE funding work?<br></strong>Often a company that needs a relatively small amount of money or struggles to raise via a funding round, will resort to SAFE funding. Sometimes, when an investor who <a href=""https://altshare.com/resources-cat/show-any-investor-or-angel-you-mean-business/?utm_source=website+-+blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=glossary+link+for+the+word+investor+hesitates"" id="""">hesitates</a> to invest a large amount will find it acceptable to invest under a SAFE agreement. When both sides agree to a SAFE and the terms are set, two main calculation methods are stated: Discount and Valuation Cap.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Discount</p><p id="""">This method dictates a pre-set discount in percentage, this discount will be deducted from the share value at the moment of the stock validation event. The discount is always from the PPS of the new round, for example: if a company raised <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?whatarethepreferredstocks%3F=&utm_source=website+-+blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=glossary+link+for+the+word+preferred+stocks"" id="""">preferred A</a> shares at a PPS of 5$, and the discount is 25%, the PPS for the SAFE holder will be 5*(1-25%). The validation doesn't need to be a complex one such as a 409A valuation, sometimes a post-money valuation will do. The event conditions will be sealed in the SAFE agreement so both sides will know exactly how to address each situation.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Valuation Cap</p><p id="""">Here the shares will be subjected to a set price but with a cap on the minimum value. Investors funding companies that increase their value over time won't meet this minimum as it defines the lowest share price compared to the entire <a href=""https://altshare.com/resources-cat/409a-vs-post-money-valuation/?utm_source=website+-+blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=glossary+link+for+the+word+company+value"" id="""">company’s value</a>. This method will commonly increase its profitability as the company value rises so it is safe to say investors' shares will be calculated by this method for highly profitable companies.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why do investors often invest via SAFE?</strong></p><p id="""">The answer to this question is a bit tricky since most investors don’t invest via SAFE, but those who do have several reasons:</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Small investment amount</p><p id="""">We explained earlier that when a company needs only a relatively small amount, it will turn to SAFE funding, which is also true for investors looking to divide their <a href=""https://altshare.com/portfolio-management/?utm_source=website+-+blog&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=glossary+link+for+the+word+portfolio"" id="""">portfolios</a>. Others just don’t have huge amounts to spare and have short budgets yet look to invest. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Profit-to-risk opportunity</p><p id="""">Companies with a lot of potential but require just a small amount until their next round or an IPO might be a dream deal for some investors. To create a hugely successful business a small push is sometimes required and companies that show progress while looking for that small push, are considered a safe investment.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Close circle</p><p id="""">Often friends or family looking to show their belief in your company will offer funds. Receiving their investment under a SAFE is a decent way to receive this small amount without signing it as a round.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion</strong></p><p id="""">SAFE funding is a method to sell shares of a private company to an investor without listing it as a funding round. Unlike other convertible loans, SAFE usually does not accumulate interest. SAFE is often for smaller amounts and gives many benefits to the investor while allowing the founder to raise funds when he struggles in his funding round. </p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc966416c397a0_6.11.png,Article

This article will explain what is usually asked in due diligence, what's important to remember, and what digital aids can be used to assist along the way.</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What is a Due Diligence (DD)?</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">When a small company or a startup caught the interest the eye of an investor or a big company, they will often want to know that this promising seed has strong roots. It means that they will ask “what are you made of?” and then push you to prove it through every aspect possible. Although it sounds a little frightening, the DD is usually predictable as it is built mostly the same, with extras or variations regarding different industries. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">A Due Diligence (DD) requires:</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">These reports are commonly required by most DD requests you will meet along your way:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Human Resources DD </li><li id="""">Employee &amp; Management DD (former and present)</li><li id="""">Administrative DD</li><li id="""">Financial DD (former and ongoing)</li><li id="""">Legal &amp; strategic DD</li><li id="""">Deals DD (suppliers and sales)</li><li id="""">Capital structure DD (including loans)</li><li id="""">Tech reports DD(codes concept, servers info, etc.)</li><li id="""">Intellectual property (including contracts regarding it for former employees)</li><li id="""">Optional: if there are somewhat questionable investors or partners, they might be required to an additional DD of their own</li></ol><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Why do investors and companies ask for a DD?</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">The time of the DD is the opportunity for an investor to interact with his investment closely, the reason is simple, to get an early identification of opportunities and risk factors, and to deny any concept of foul play that will affect himself or his potential future portfolio company in any matter. The largest example of a wrongly done DD that eventually caused significant damage, is the case of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elizabeth_Holmes"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Elizabeth Anne Holmes</a>. </p><p id="""">Holmes founded Theranos, a health-tech company that soared in valuation after the company claimed to have revolutionized blood testing by developing a method that only needs a small fingerprick. By 2015, Forbes named Holmes the youngest and wealthiest self-made female billionaire in America. Merely a year later her net value dropped to zero after firm accusations of her being a fraud, started to surface. The question is, how could Holmes recruit so many funds without anyone realizing she has nothing? Well, when investors are dazzled by a saleswoman's personality, looks, and well-constructed speech, they neglect the most important protector of every great deal, the DD.</p><p id="""">This case made waves across the financial community and made people reevaluate the importance of the DD, it protects the investor and helps prepare for anything that might come. The funded company also benefits from an opened, well-constructed DD as she will be covered if any claim will be made to foul play.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Important guidelines</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Keep cash not information<br></em>Honesty is key to any successful DD. When submitting information to a DD make sure to keep it as clear as possible, information that might seem unimportant at the moment might lead to a lawsuit ahead. To prevent cases that require money that sometimes is hard to come by, most of the time an <a href=""https://altshare.com/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">Escrow Service</a> is required by the hands of a trustee. As we often play the role of the trustee we’ve witnessed first-hand many companies drag through court years after a merge or an exit, just because they didn’t reveal some so-called irrelevant information in the DD process.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Make realistic promises<br></em>There is a fine line between a good sales pitch to exaggeration, never say something you can't back up. Many investors and large companies will move to the next level after an incredible meeting, but the next level includes the DD, and therefore you will have to prove everything that was just promised. What if you can’t stand behind your pitch? Then you might want to go back to the drawing board because this door might have just been closed forever.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Organize your (data) room<br></em>Consider working via a <a href=""https://altshare.com/data-room/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">digital data room</a>. A data room is a great way to seamlessly apply every document needed. It is basically a virtual binder, containing everything you want or required with a permission limitation, to show only what you want however you want. If you drop and organize every document in your data room, when the time for the DD comes, all you need to do is just open excess to the relevant investor.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">What’s on the table?<br></em>When creating the Due Diligence, notice that all the capital structure DD is basically a well-made Cap Table, if you didn't neglect it so far it shouldn't be a problem for you. If you run an <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/"" target=""_blank"" id="""">automated Cap-Table</a> just extract it as a hole and vuala! Your capital structure report is done. If your Caps are via a spreadsheet, just make sure everything is updated, add every stock owner's unique privilege, and you are good to go. Keep in mind that If you have a spreadsheet version you most probably be required to show a few cap tables from different time periods in order to give the same perspective.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Run the table to a waterfall<br></em>Although the capital structure DD is completely based on the cap table, there are a few more reports and important information it can provide. If you have an automated cap table, multiple investment and waterfall scenarios can be made in order to inspect all possible outcomes of this deal and provide important information to adjust. Although a spreadsheet cap table might not be as effective here, you can still ask whoever runs it for you to create a single scenario that is crucial to you (take into consideration that it might take a few weeks).</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">In order to finalize any major deal, you might be required to go through due diligence. This thorough inspection will make sure your company is what you claim it to be and find any red flags along the way. We advise giving any information you find, no matter how insignificant or harmful it might seem. A data room and a cap table are important tools to help build the way for the capital structure report and help set the ground for a trusted interaction between you - the founder, and your soon-to-be investor.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc9641bcc398a9_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%96%D7%9D-%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9-71-5.png,Article

In the USA this regulation is called <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accounting_for_leases_in_the_United_States"" id="""">ASC 842</a> and its European parallel is the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IFRS_16"" id="""">IFRS 16</a>. Although this regulation was a must in some scenarios, several changes and clarifications are now implanted. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Neglecting this fact is possible within private companies only, yet doing so might cause <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Financial_statement"" id="""">disclosure</a> to be listed under this sector. Any disclosure adds a pinch of uncertainty to the accounting book's credibility which might prevent investors to put their trust (and money) in the company. Fear not because this article will explain everything you need to know about IFRS 16 and ASC 842. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Here you will find answers to:</strong></p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id=""""> What is IFRS 16?</strong></li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">What is ASC 842?</strong></li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">How to enlist rentals and leasing in the accounting books?</strong></li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Should you follow the IFRS 16 / ASC 842 regulations?</strong></li></ul><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">How to do a credit risk measurement for rentals and leased possessions?</strong></li></ul><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">IFRS 16 and ASC 842</strong></p><p id="""">Many accounting regulations have a twin on the other side of the globe. These regulations are no different, excluding some nuances, ASC 842 is the American IFRS 16 and vice versa. This regulation addresses the when, where, how, and if a certain rental or lease should be stated in the accountant's financial books.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">While both are commonly considered a must for public companies, the IFRS 16 is only mandatory for private companies since 2019. ASC 842 on the other hand became mandatory for private companies just recently (Jan 2022). As many CFOs are now starting to prepare to finalize this year’s books it is important to remember this regulation is now often mandatory.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Stating rentals and leasing to the accounting books</strong></p><p id="""">Unlike other statements, to follow the guidelines for a proper fair market value enlisting, a professional is required. Only a dedicated accountant for this purpose can accurately accomplish the necessary calculations, as they are comprehensive and a bit tricky. In any way, it is recommended to consult with your accountant about whether or not the IFRS 16 or ASC 842 should apply to you.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Should you follow the IFRS 16 / ASC 842 regulations?</strong></p><p id="""">Well, the short answer is YES, it is definitely and highly recommended to avoid any disclosure to appear in your books. When facing a <a href=""https://altshare.com/equity-plan-administartion/"" id="""">potential investor</a> or people you desire to add to your board, disclosures relating to the financial upkeep may come as a bright red flag. To avoid adding difficulty to an already unpleasant situation, it is highly recommended to follow the regulations and to quadruple check 10 times if your company should or shouldn't do so.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">That being said, a few scenarios do not require upkeeping these regulations but as we stated earlier, please consult with your accountant before deciding how to act. If a company holds a rental contract that is signed less than a year prior to the statement they don’t have to apply the IFRS 16 and ASC 842. For example, a company working in a shared working space location won't be obligated to report under the regulation because their contact is commonly up to 3 months ahead.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Another reason to legally ignore the IFRS 16 and ASC 842 relies on magnitude. If the leased item is considered to be insignificant to the company’s complete financial statement (leased keyboards for example) it can be stated without adjusting it to a <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fairmarketvalue.asp"" id="""">fair market value</a>. As always accounting is a game of numbers, any expanse value is sometimes arbitrary and subjected to the company’s total expenses. Other times it is highly precise and obligated to specific numbers within the regulations. In the case of the IFRS 16 and ASC 842 regulations, it varies so make sure to understand exactly the value of your rentals before deciding what to neglect from the reports.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Credit risk measurement for rentals and leased possessions</strong></p><p id="""">In order to accumulate any contract for rentals and leased possessions under a fair market value (in accordance with the IFRS 16 \ ASC 842), credit risk measurement and an effective interest must be calculated first. Unfortunately, only a few companies can quickly and efficiently, come by a precise credit risk measurement as well as an effective interest that is compiled with IFRS 16 and ASC 842. Fortunately, <a href=""https://altshare.com/"" id="""">Altshare</a> is one of them. We happily consult any company that struggles to understand these regulations. We offer a complete effective interest calculation to any rented or leased equity, and a fast credit risk measurement.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Even if for some reason you decide to go through this process without Altshare, we highly recommend using <a href=""https://altshare.com/"" id="""">trusted professionals</a>, imprecise bookkeeping might become a nightmare story up ahead. Make sure the accountant or company your pick can adjust both regulations and understand the new updates as well as how to calculate the credit risk measurement within leased possessions. An effective interest that complies with the IFRS 16 and ASC 842 regulations can be tricky so choose carefully who will accomplish this for you.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion</strong></p><p id="""">The 2022 update to IFRS 16 and its American twin ASC 842 obligates private companies to enlist their accounting books rented and leased company possessions under fair market value. To do so, they must come by their credit risk measurement and for each rental or leased contract, an effective interest. Not many companies can accomplish this feat for both IFRS 16 and ASC 842, effectively Altshare can. Although on some occasions a company does not require to follow these regulations, even after the recent updates, it is still highly recommended to consult with a trusted expert.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc96e77dc397cd_ASDF.png,Article

From that moment forward, this aspect of <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?whatisequity?"" id="""">equity</a> will keep on growing, exponentially. For this reason, the <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?whatisacaptable?"" id="""">capitalization table</a> was invented and is considered the foundation for the company's financial database. From the occasional check-ups to <a href=""https://altshare.com/resources-cat/the-due-and-the-dont/"" id="""">due diligence</a> or a <a href=""https://altshare.com/409a-valuation/"" id="""">financial valuation</a>, the cap table will remain the knowledge base, source of information, and source when an equity query needs solving. </p><p id="""">This is why deciding who should run the cap table is sometimes crucial and needs deep consideration. The majority of times, equity management is done either externally via the company's lawyer or outsourced CFO as an added service, or internally with one of the founders’ team or via a CFO. Each of these cap managers has its own unique pros and cons, in this article, we will discuss them all, so by the end, you will have all the information to pick the best fit for your company.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Digital vs The Sheet Way</strong></p><p id=""""><br>Before we break down each cap manager, there's one important thing that should be addressed. Long long ago, when dinosaurs walked the earth and a company's equity data would be written on paper and kept in file cabinets, came the computer. With it, a new way to save data was introduced and most professionals started creating a <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/"" id="""">digital spreadsheet cap table</a>. </p><p id="""">Today's spreadsheet belongs to the ancient history section, and most professionals in 2022 use an automated cap table, where the two most significant differences are: the decrease in human error &amp; dependency, and the options section that used to need constant maintenance, and now goes fully automatic.</p><p id="""">To put it in practical words, a requirement for information from the cap table relayed on the availability of a person: sick day, working hours, phone reception, etc., as well as his notice for details, as many small updates would commonly fall between the seats only to be discovered at the moment of truth. This is why although we will consider every aspect of each cap table manager, it is crucial to understand if they use an automated cap table because no matter who it is, they can’t be professionals if they use a spreadsheet, as it leaves an opening for many mistakes that can easily be avoided. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Lawyers</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">In many cases, a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_firm"" id="""">law office</a> will offer cap table management as part of their service. A designated person in the firm will be in charge of the process and will add their working time for you to the charged hours the firm agreed upon.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Pros</em><br>You will probably pay for legal representation and advice either way, so this service won't cost much and you will be required to a minimum to no interaction with this financial subject on a day-to-day basis. For people that aren't nervous to get everything the second they ask for it, this is a highly cost-effective partnership.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Cons</em><br>Consider that in most cases the firm running your cap table has its own way to note everything, so there isn’t coherency when a dedicated professional tries to understand it. &nbsp;As in most law firms, the cap table is run in its spreadsheet version, once the person trusted to manage it becomes unreachable, the cap table they’ll leave behind will be impossible to understand. So you might be stranded on an island of equity chaos, surrounded by sharks asking for rapid information.</p><p id="""">Furthermore, even if the cap table is automated, if you will not have access to it, it’ll stay unavailable as long as the firm is closed or preoccupied (as you're not their only client). In this case, low-cost might be priced as time, for the “here and now people” the need to wait for the information to the morning is a nightmare.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Outsource CFO</strong></p><p id=""""><br>Similar to lawyers, this is a service provider, offering everything a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_financial_officer"" id="""">CFO</a> does in a company without a large paycheck or a seat at the shareholders' table. Here the cap table management will be integrated as part of the responsibilities of the person in charge of your company at the service giver office. </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Pros</em><br>A professional from a company specialized in the CFO responsibilities at your disposal. No need to allocate shares, open a benefits plan, or look for the perfect candidate for the job. Founders looking to get a dedicated manager with strong abilities but don’t wish to add a seat around the table might find this a good solution.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Cons</em><br>As described earlier, the problem with every service giver out of the company’s employee manifest is the availability. Although a professional might run your cap table, there will be times the information will be unobtainable as they might go on vacation, become sick, or simply unavailable at the moment you need them to be.</p><p id="""">The matter of cost has a strong play when it comes to an outsourced CFO, as it is not a must like a law firm. Taking this kind of service will be costly to beginning companies or founders that prefer to get a full availability in exchange for their money, so a cost-effective game here is hard to establish with this kind of outsourcing.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Founders</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">The “I'll do it myself” approach, although most entrepreneurs aren't <a href=""https://altshare.com/resources/"" id="""">equity masters</a>, with an automated cap table it isn’t very hard to play it solo. Some people prefer to keep the financial management and specifically the equity management of a company close to heart as it is a delicate subject.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Pros</em><br>You know everything. As long as you keep everything updated (with an automated cap table it isn’t hard) you should have an immediate and complete picture at all times. As an extra feat, some automated cap tables have the ability to create<a href=""https://altshare.com/scenario-modeling/"" id=""""> founding and waterfall scenarios</a>. So for those lying in bed, imagining things that might happen with the company, and thinking how it should look and affect everything. All they need to do is log in, run the scenario, and put their mind at ease.</p><p id=""""><em id="""">Cons</em><br>Founders have their hands full constantly, adding another thing, small as it might seem can be a lot. Forgetting to address the minimum requirements might create chaos in equity management and will create significant problems ahead. For people that prefer to keep improving their business with their expertise, and let professionals take over where they lack, this might not be the best fit.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Chief Financial Officers - CFOs</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id=""""><br></strong>The ace of all trades when it comes to in-house financial management, a professional taking the control of the cap table management and making sure it stays updated and reliable at all times. </p><p id="""">Pros<br>When you employ a professional they're at your disposal, so as long as you work on an automated cap table, everything they update, you can access at any time. You enjoy all the benefits the system can give like scenario runs, growth &amp; upcoming reports, and real-time equity presentation, and all that without giving it a second of your time. </p><p id="""">Cons<br>You might not give your time but you probably will be asked to give some of your company. A CFO is considered to be at its minimum at a VP level, so most people will ask for company shares in some kind of form. For founders looking to keep the dilution as thin as possible, this is a thing to consider.</p><p id="""">The spreadsheet vs automated comes to play once more, because a CFOs time is worth a lot of money, spending it on updating the spreadsheet is a true waste.

Whether they wish to create the report internally (via CFO or so) or with the help of a professional company, the process remains the same and is often tricky.</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Step one of the process usually contains an economic &nbsp;assessment of the value of all stock-based grants, including <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp"" id="""">vested</a> and unvested stock options. then as step two, a correlation to that value is made throughout a time period, specified by the contracts and grant letters. To put it in simpler words: we calculate what is the total worth of any stock-based grant ever given and lay it on a timetable.</p><p id="""">One of the more common events in which the stock-based compensation report’s bottom line varies, and will affect the entire financial report balance, is commonly called a modification. Generally speaking, modification means a reevaluation and assessment of the stock-based compensation expense.</p><p id="""">When talking about modification, most will probably think of Repricing - a dropdown for stock options buy-in price, specified in the grant letters given to employees and such. This common phenomenon usually occurs when a company’s assessed stock worth drops, and the buy-in price offered to employees needs an update in order to stay attractive. Though a repricing process counts as a modification, they are not the same, a repricing is merely a fraction in the deep sea of modification.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Companies might unknowingly neglect some processes that also go under modification and will lead to a false financial report. This problem might surface by the audit team and in this better scenario will cause a back and forth with them as well as many useless hours spent on solving the issue. The worst-case scenario will meet a company at the end of the road, and might be an entrepreneur’s worst nightmare: a long delay in the yearned Exit at the end of the road. This delay can be interpreted by future investors and stock traders as a high risk, they can hesitate and think more than twice before joining the party.</p><p id="""">So what are the other processes that sit under the definition of modification? Here are three that are actually highly common and often fall between the seats:</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Expected term modification</strong></p><p id="""">A <a href=""https://altshare.com/equity-plan-administartion/"" id="""">stock-option compensation</a> or grant usually has two time periods specified in any given grant letter: The first, define the actual grant’s benefits expiration date (commonly set to ten years from signing). The second, specify the grace period in which a person can buy a vested option, offered to him after he is no longer an employee.<br>Because the readjust of those time periods implies a change in the total worth of the company’s stock-based compensation options over time, it is considered a modification and should be addressed as such.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Change in Grant Letter Condition</strong></p><p id="""">When a grant condition gets a statistical upgrade towards its financial probability it is considered as a modification.<br>Generally speaking, there are three common stock-based grant conditions - Grant by Market(unexpected statistical scenario), Grant by Performance (good statistical scenario), and Grant by Service (the best statistical scenario - “A Sure Thing”).</p><p id="""">Grant by Market is the statistically unexpected of the three, it means the person will receive a vested amount of option if, and only if, the company will one day come close to an Exit or Liquidation.<br>Grant by Performance is more possible and easy to acquire, it defines a number of vested stock options to be given every time an employee hits a target mark (set in his approved grant letter), this is mostly given to people specializing in sales or other achievement-based positions.<br>Grant by Service is the last but certainly not least, as it is the most popular among the three. It basically means a person will receive an unvested stock option that will gradually vast upon a service given to the company. The most common example is employment - you will work for me, and every specified period a percentage of that predetermined unvested options will become vested.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Capital Structure Change</strong></p><p id="""">When a small private company merges with a larger one (private or commercial) the price of each company’s stock is probably different. The uneven worth is called a difference in the &nbsp;Incremental Value, which is also considered a modification.</p><p id="""">At the end of the day, the yearly <a href=""https://altshare.com/ASC-718/"" id="""">SBC expense report</a> might be hard at first but don’t let it overwhelm you. With the right approach, it can be done with ease and mistakes-free. The report for stock-based compensations is an important part that shouldn't be mistreated or abandoned. It is probably the best option to acquire the assistance of a company that specializes in this kind of thing and will smoothen down this sometimes hard-to-swallow pill.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc96ec84c39844_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%96%D7%9D-%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9-71-4.png,Article
What Are Your Stock Options Vesting Options?,what-are-your-stock-options-vesting-options,642adfbf50fc9661adc39701,642adfbf50fc962687c398a2,Thu Dec 15 2022 04:01:37 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Dec 15 2022 04:03:04 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Dec 15 2022 04:03:17 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Picking The Right Stock Options Vesting Plan For Your Employees,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">When founders lay the basics for their startup, an equity-based compensation plan is often being set. Allowing your key employees to enjoy a financial profit that is based on the success of the company, is considered to be extremely beneficial for both the company and the employee.</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">The hired talent may gain a significant amount of money and partial ownership of the company. The owner that is probably short on money at the moment, doesn’t have to spend immediate funds in order to recruit, he also enjoys an employee that is vested (no pun intended) in the company's success. </p><p id="""">Although it sounds like Employee Stock Options Plans have one simple approach, there is a tricky part. After creating a dedicated stock options compensation pool, this is the time to fully understand what <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/vesting.asp"" id="""">vesting</a> triggers there are and decide which are the best for you. Don’t worry, that is what we’re here for, we will show you the top three plans often offered and explain their ups and downs. Shall we begin?</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Timeline-based compensation<br></strong>The most common and often what people imagine when the subject of stock options comes up. This scenario gives the employee a set amount of unvested options that will mature over a time period, and only as a result of him providing a specific service (such as being an employee or a consultant). </p><p id="""">A plan of this kind typically offers the first vested options after a long period (Cliff), and then reduces the vesting period as time goes by. This is the company’s way to ensure only long-term employees will enjoy the opportunity to become a part of the shareholders. This timetable also helps keep the talents at hand, they will refrain from looking or signing with other pursuers as they expect significant gain up ahead. </p><p id="""">One major CON this plan has is that it doesn't differ between the hard-working and the ordinary. Every employee who received a stock options plan will eventually have the opportunity to purchase options, so some might take advantage of this fact and won’t put significant effort into their work. Companies usually have employees who give 160% and others that never reach a 100%, both will eventually receive the same.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Performance-based compensation</strong></p><p id="""">If you are a believer in KPIs (Key Performance Indicator) and Milestones this is exactly for you, it defines a pre-allocated amount of stock options that will gradually vest with each goal reached. Often offered to people specializing in sales, this is a great way to defer the good from the best as it allows only those who reach certain determined goals to become an actual part of the stockholders. Take all the time you want, if you don’t shine you won’t dine.</p><p id="""">This is a great way to inspire some of your employees to go the extra mile, it sends the message that their hard work will be recognized and compensated. Another great PRO is its flexibility, there are no pre-set definitions or milestones so you can just pick whatever goals seem reasonable and vary them with each new employee.</p><p id="""">The CON might seem significant to some and not important to others but nonetheless, it exists, sometimes pushing a person to your goals might give them a nudge towards the door. Not everyone likes to add stress to their work, and some will prefer to look for a job with a different compensation method.</p><p id="""">Furthermore, if the milestones aren’t set properly, a person might be able to acquire stocks within a short period of time. Seeing a person succeed quickly may cause certain people to “fight” their teammates in order to gain success resulting in a hostile work environment.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Company goals-based compensation </strong></p><p id="""">Simply speaking, this method means: If we make it you make it. An employee (often an executive) is given stock options that will vest altogether in a case of a constitutive event such as an Exit, a funding investment, Share price, etc. here the actual vesting stage is not directly influenced by the actual worker. He might work for the company for six long years without having any vested options, or it might go the other way around, just started working and having many vested options because the company surprisingly had a big change. </p><p id="""">An interesting example of this type of vesting scenario can often be seen in pharmaceutical companies. They tend to offer their managing staff a company goals-based compensation in the case of an FDA approval, which gives an extra boost to the employee’s involvement in the day-to-day goals, and on the grand scale.</p><p id="""">The PRO here is actually also the CON, on one hand, there’s no separation within the options plan, no milestones, or a timeline. If the company won’t succeed in the future the employee will be a part of it, he will have nothing, so technically a founder can give compensations that will cost him absolutely nothing. On the other hand, this might cause a buy-in from a person who recently started working in the company. his commitment towards the company hasn’t been tested yet, more to that is the fact that he will have a significant amount of stocks compared to the time and effort vested in the company.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">So what is the best option?</strong></p><p id="""">We can advise, but it is up to you to choose what suits you best. Try imagining what you’d like to have if you found yourself standing in the recruited shoes, think what will benefit your company the most and what is the preferred way to achieve it. After answering these two, we believe the answer will be obvious.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc969e0fc398a7_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%96%D7%9D-%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9-71-6.png,Article

Then the moment of truth comes, the investor surprisingly shows interest and it’s time to show how knowledgeable and prepared you, the founder, actually are. So now it’s do-or-die, all promises and big words aside, this is the time to show the investor you mean business, you are smart, prepared, and the best in this new field. How should you do it? This article is exactly for that, to teach you how to utilize your everyday management tools in order to wow any investor.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Your time to shine finally comes, it’s important to show how everything you claimed is strongly based on knowledge. Impressive as you may be on the personal level, a great impression includes your ability to show every aspect is already well thought out, especially the company’s financial future. How to accomplish that? Here are some methods that you can instantly apply:</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">1. <a href=""https://altshare.com/scenario-modeling/"" id=""""><strong id="""">Scenario modeling</strong><br></a>Start with going to the place all your equity is organized - your cap table, think and create a model for every significant outcome the other side might ask, and make a hard copy of it. Just think of an investor trying to hamper you with a “what if your company will…” and you just have the answer in your folder, already fully calculated and ready well thought out. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">When considering which are the best scenarios to model, try walking in the investor's shoes a bit, and tackle your own company from every angle. For example, the investor will probably consider what will be his final dilution (as a result of the stock pool set for your employees combined with far-future funding rounds). Instantly showing results, with prepared charts, breaking down exactly how it will affect every shareholder at any given moment is a true power play.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Here comes the tricky part: if you still use a spreadsheet version of a cap table, scenario modeling is a bit complicated for you, think of a single strong case and ask a professional to assemble it for you. The process of creating a well thought future scenario with a spreadsheet is no joke and might take a few weeks to create. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">If you use an <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/"" id="""">automated cap tale</a>, you do have the high ground Obi-Wan, scenario modeling should be effortless and with a click of a button. So make as many variants as you can, any scenario you can think of, make it ready in a portfolio, and show how perfectly ready you can be.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">2. <strong id="""">Show off your data room</strong><br>A <a href=""https://altshare.com/data-room/"" id="""">digital data room</a> is a great documentation management method that is commonly used by all major companies, correctly using a digital data room can easily create a wow effect. Organize every document in your company in the data room, everything should be there, from your 409As, grant letters, bank approvals, and so on. Now think of any document the investor will probably ask for in order to start the process of <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/"" id="""">due diligence</a>. If you worked up until now with a decent data room, all you will have to do is grant access to the investor. If not, fear not, you can start right now and be ready on time, any time. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Prepare authorization for the investor to the information he’ll probably require, so when asked, just send them the link and say ‘done!’. There's no better way to send the message you got everything under control than handing out, and completing any requirements the second they are asked. If you don’t know what information is usually asked in due diligence, we got you covered on that part as well, just<a href=""https://altshare.com/resources-cat/the-due-and-the-dont/"" id=""""> click here</a>.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">3. <strong id="""">Know your worth</strong><br>Do you know your company’s estimated worth? What about your stock’s value? Can you show change/growth over time? Answering these questions to yourself before sitting with an investor will base your business persona strongly. To find out the answers simply go through a company valuation or more precisely a <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?whatisa409avaluation?"" id="""">409A valuation</a>. Doing a <a href=""https://altshare.com/409a-valuation/"" id="""">409A for each year</a> that the company exists will provide value over time for itself and the common stock. This might not be the common stock price that will define this investment but it will provide a strong indication to build from.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">From this information, you can prepare and know what stock price you wish to negotiate, show the founder you already thought everything out, and can talk business. Any person you are bound to do business with will be encouraged to see that you both speak the same language in every aspect, especially when it comes to the investment itself.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Now it’s up to you</strong></p><p id="""">Hopefully, up to this moment, you learned a thing or two about making your presentation better and more appealing. Don’t forget to start any preparation with thorough research, then apply the information to your cap table, data room, and company information you hold, and be the best you can at the informal level. Then back it up by preparing for every scenario, any question, or any assessment.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc9684fdc397e2_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%96%D7%9D-%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9-71-4-4-3-1.png,Article

The situation is made up, but rest assured that the answers and opinions are all direct or simplified quotes from the giants themselves. Shall we begin?</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Interviewer: “Let’s kick off even before step one, some readers are probably thinking about what should they pursue. Richard Bernson, in your point of view, what idea or skill is worth turning into a business?”</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Richard Bernson</strong>: “well In most cases, you can turn your passion into a business, think about what frustrates you in that field, think of a gap you can cover. Remember that nothing is too simple, even if you think a hundred people already thought about this solution, there’s might be no one with the courage to actually go through with it, don't be afraid to act. Then, persistency is key, you will fail, question is, will you pick yourself up and try again? Only in a positive approach you can accomplish positive things, think of an idea that will make a positive change in people’s lives, and RUN! To be successful you have to hit the ground running”.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Jack Ma</strong>: “I couldn’t agree more, optimism is critical, an entrepreneur must always stay optimistic when thinking of the future. <strong id="""">Jeff Bezos</strong>: “True, and never stop thinking in the matters of long term, it’s the only way to accomplish crazy things, if I will ask you to solve world hunger in three years you’ll tell me it’s impossible, but if I gave you a hundred years, you might come up with a plan that can be actually put to use”. <strong id="""">Ma</strong>: “I would suggest staying down to earth tough, always know where you want to be in 10 years, that's the only way to make people follow you, but remember to count the pennies so you can survive this year as well”.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Ma</strong>: “And if you want to start, think about what problem you can solve, how will you solve it better than others? Different than others? And why can you do it better than others”? <strong id="""">Jobs</strong>: “And as Branson said, you must run for it! Even people who want to get to heaven aren't willing to die to get there, the noise around you is just noise, believe in your passion and go all the way, it is not a certain way to success but it is the only way to get there”.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Interviewer: “Interesting, so your message to our readers is to ‘pick what you are passionate about, try to spot something that troubles you in that field that you think can be solved, and just go for it as hard as you can’. Very inspiring.” </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">“now let’s talk about something I think most of you will agree upon, it’s considered important to find co-founders to run alongside you. Is it true? Should entrepreneurs fly solo or find good co-pilots?”</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Jack Ma</strong>: It is crucial to find people to work around you who believe in your cause with the same passion that you have. <strong id="""">Bill Gates</strong>: “yes, and you should definitely find people who complete you, &nbsp;I needed to relearn what is a weekend only after I was really successful. So it’s very important to find a selected group of people to share this kind of sacrifice with you”. “only you know your weaknesses, with the right group of people, you have no weaknesses”. <strong id="""">Musk</strong>: ”Abilities are important, but from my personal experience I came to the understanding that when you are looking for people the biggest mistake is to trust a person's skills rather than its character. <strong id="""">Ma</strong>: “I agree with Musk. when you look for those people there is no such a thing as ‘the best people’ so find people you connect with and they will be the best, work with them, train them, let them train you”.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Interviewer: “Alright, I understand you all agree that it’s not a solo mission but rather to focus on abilities or personality remains a disagreement. Now, what would you consider as the most valuable resource for a company in its first steps?</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Richard Branson</strong>: “I think, and it’s true for all companies not only first stagers, there’s nothing more important than investing in the people around you, the day that you will be down can come and they will be the only ones there to pick you up”. <strong id="""">Ma</strong>: “Oh definitely, invest an equal amount of time with your clients and your employees. Don’t spend your time making the investors happy, if the employees will be happy and the clients will be happy, your investors will be happy”. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Bill Gates</strong>: “This is something I wish more founders will understand, employees were always on my mind, Always, even in my hardest times, I made sure to have enough money to pay all my employees for at least one year, this is the preferred amount of cash a company should always hold”. <strong id="""">Bezos</strong>: “I take a different approach, business-wise, it’s also important keeping your key employees close, owners think in longer terms than renters. Don’t be afraid to allocate stock options to your star employees, keep them involved in the company to its core”.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Warren Buffett:</strong> “Let me add a tip from my personal experience: When recruiting, look for intellect, energy, and honesty. But remember that without honesty the other two are a threat, you wouldn't want a dishonest, brilliant, energetic star around you”.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Interviewer: “Thank you, Warren Buffett, for this important tip, and let me refer to you now. Among other things, you are known for smart investments in early-stage companies, Can you give us your input about what to focus on for a company aiming to improve itself?”</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Buffett</strong>: “I believe, there is great importance in taking your competitors into consideration, the greatest danger for the leading business is to stop competing, the competitors will never stop and you are never too big to complete. Understanding <a href=""https://www.britannica.com/topic/capitalism"" id="""">capitalism </a>is to realize that when you are at the lead it’s like having a castle”. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">“Capitalism means that someone is always coming to take away your castle from you, what you need is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moat"" id="""">moat</a>.

To make sure you stay ahead you should always put your effort into research, not only on the successful, read about those who failed, understand why they failed and what can you learn from it”. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">“Hmm I think data is super important, and let me add something about collecting data”, interviewer: yes <strong id="""">Elon Musk</strong>? “I recommend not using analogies to make conclusions, it’s useless to try and learn from ‘something that has been done and similar to my business’ trust data you gathered yourself”. <strong id="""">Buffett</strong>: “I couldn't agree more, Give your attention to the facts, and not what you feel the market should be”. <strong id="""">Musk</strong>: “yes and also give attention to your ability to overcome errors, a companies success is measured by the amount of time it takes her to correct an error, it’s never the issue if she makes errors because she does, everyone does - it’s the time it takes to fix it that counts”. <strong id="""">Buffett</strong>: “Listen to what Elon said people, I can’t tell you how important it is to leave room for errors. You wouldn't drive a truck weighing 999 pounds on a bridge with a maximum capacity of a thousand pounds right? Leave a place for error and to correct those errors”. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Interviewer: Jeff Bezos, I see you’re nodding your head, <strong id="""">Bezos</strong>: “So about room for error I don’t have anything to add, but personally, I don’t put that much of a focus on my competitors. Instead, I tend to focus on the clients, fighting the competitors is counterproductive in the long run, there will always be unhappy customers so focus on them”. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">“Focusing your clients will help keep growing even if you are at the top, because if you focused on the competitors, once you’ve surpassed them, there is no one to beat. learn from your clients, actively look for feedback and recurring compliments, there you will find the way to get better. Look for the root of the compliment and don't patch things, solve the root of any problem you find”.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Interviewer: “Thank you for the input, it’s interesting to see that there are essentially two different perspectives when it comes to growing your company: one is to keep competing and always stay focused on your competition. The other is to invest the attention on the customers and work on the feedback from them as a way to keep improving”. “Is there anything anyone wants to add? any tip you think should be said?”</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Musk</strong>: “Let me finish by saying that no matter what you do, love it, don’t like it - be in love with it, a business doesn’t always succeed so at least enjoy the path so you can learn from it better”. Remember that any company is first of all destined to fail, you need to accept those failures and push forward, don’t avoid failure, it is coming. You start with an idea, it's probably wrong, so listen to criticism and clear out the noise, look for ‘quality criticism’, it will often come from your friends, some won't share it with you but you must ask for it.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Ma</strong>: “Here we drift apart Elon, I think that If you believe the future is at what you do, don't listen to criticism. If someone claims the market is cold, you should be there before it gets warm, if everyone thinks you are going for a good investment it means you don't have a place there”. Especially If the government says ‘ok, we can facilitate this’ don’t go for this, move away” (*laughs).</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Jobs</strong>: “Ma, not listening to criticism is very hard to accomplish but I can offer a way: there is a phrase ‘If you live each day as if it were your last, someday you’ll most certainly be right’ Thinking your end is near can help confront this fear people have of ‘something to lose’ in life, so there’s no reason to avoid following your heart”.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Interviewer: “Incredible words for closing Steve Jobs (RIP), thank you all so much for inspiring people all over the globe. Your words help dreamers become entrepreneurs, and founders turn their startups into successful companies.

Why? what makes it expire? And common mistakes to avoid,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">When employing Americans and offering </strong><a href=""https://altshare.com/knowitall/?whatarestockoptions?"" id=""""><strong id="""">equity-based compensation</strong></a><strong id=""""> to them, a 409A valuation becomes important, as it's the only way to offer stock options by the regulations of the US tax revision and avoid high taxation. Although the 409A is commonly known as option price modeling (OPM) this two are not alike. This article will explain the difference between them, and will shed light on this important but not fully understood 409A.</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What is Section 409A?</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">It is a US regulation for nonqualified deferred compensations obligated an added income tax of about 20% on top of the regular tax. In order to assist startups and encourage them, the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Service"" id="""">IRS </a>offered an exemption to section 409A for stock-based compensations.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What is a 409A Valuation?</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">It is a process that its end result is the estimation of a private company’s <a href=""https://altshare.com/knowitall/?whatarecommonstocks?"" id="""">common stock</a> price. A public company in most cases is traded in an exchange market and therefore already has an updated stock price, in a private company the stock price is often arbitrary and the exercise price tends to be freely estimated over the company’s course.</p><p id="""">The United States established the 409A of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) in order to define a specific way to tax stock options given as an incentive to employees. In order to avoid this harsh taxation, the US gave a few ground roles to follow, one of them is to allocate the stock option with an exercise price equal or greater than the Fair Market Value (FMV) of common stock, This FMV calculation is called a 409A valuation.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What is the difference between 409A and OPM?</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">An OPM or in its full name option price modeling, is the calculation method commonly used to make the 409A. If the estimated common stock price is the target, and the 409A is the way to reach there, the OPM is the vessel used.</p><p id="""">This calculating model works in a simple yet effective way: it divides the equity total worth between the levels of grants and stocks given (such as common, preferred, SAFE, etc.). The input is then subtracted by a <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dlom.asp"" id="""">Discount Lack of Marketability</a>, which is determined by an educated valuation of the stock price taking into account the preferred stocks given. The final outcome is the number of an estimated common stock price that can be published and planned upon until it expires.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">When will my 409A expire?</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">The 409A is valid for one year exactly, so every year should have a new evaluation at its doorsteps. That being said, there is one more case in which a 409A stops being valid and needs a do-over, that is any major financial event. </p><p id="""">The majority of the time, a financial event that will force a new 409A valuation are a new <a href=""https://altshare.com/knowitall/?whatisafundinground?"" id="""">funding round</a>, a merger, an Exit, or an IPO. That being said, every field has its own significant game-changer events that might have an impact as well. In the medical-tech field, for example, an FDA approval is considered a huge milestone and will set the need for a redo of the 409A.</p><p id="""">Another fearsome process that includes the need for an updated 409A valuation is the <a href=""https://altshare.com/resources-cat/what-to-expect-when-expensing/"" id="""">SBC expensing</a>. When a company needs to acknowledge its stock options as a financial expense it will have to show an underline asset valuation that can be subtracted as part of the 409A. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Important 409A guidelines </strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">It’s a must even when it’s not</em></p><p id=""""><em id=""""><br></em>You might not feel it in the first few years but avoiding the 409A isn't a good idea. On some occasions, when the company has just a handful of employees, technically the 409A can be avoided. This fact comes with a big warning sign: whenever you will be required to add an SBC expensing report to your financial report, you will have to apply 409A for each year that has passed without it. Realizing after half a decade that you need to come by five 409As at once, will be a headache to remember.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Save your 409As and they will save you</em></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Even though you will probably apply a 409A every year and they might stack up as time goes by, don’t forget to save every related document. When a company is going through a <a href=""https://altshare.com/resources-cat/the-due-and-the-dont/"" id="""">due diligence</a> process they are often required to present the change in common stock price over the years AKA comparison of the 409As bottom line. If you save the information with a <a href=""https://altshare.com/data-room/"" id="""">dedicated data room</a>, filling in the information requires no effort on your behalf. If you have a different way to store the information or even use hard copies it is highly recommended to put the minimal effort required and save all the 409As from the first year and so on.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Grants come second</em></p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id=""""><br></em>Unfortunately, it is common for companies to sign grant letters to employees before they finish the 409A. In the US, 409A is mandatory but regardless, this valuation should be accomplished before any grant is offered to a new recruit. Signing a grant letter with a vague estimation of the stock price will create an exercising price that is unconnected to reality. The true numbers might make the exercising price overrated and therefore useless to the employee, or underrated and will hand leverage to other employees or potential recruits, in larger scales (9% total stocks or higher) it can also affect the stock value.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Expiration date or event</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Keep track of your 409A and make sure it stays valid. Remember, the 409A might be valid for one year but it can also be expired after a major event. Each company has different events that might count as major so make sure you and the dedicated IRS are on the same page regarding what counts as a major event so you won't fall between the seats.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">It takes time</em></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Take into consideration the time it takes to create and apply the 409A. If you use an <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/"" id="""">automated cap table</a> the information will be fast and easy to come by so it should take no more than a week at the hands of an expert. If you use a spreadsheet cap table or any other version, the modeling might take longer, about two weeks or so. Give this time tables attention so you won't suffer from late fees or other problems in reports submissions and such.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Every year, a private company should file for a 409A valuation, which is recommended in general but when it comes to employing Americans it’s a must. The 409A is better known for its calculating method OPM, and is valid for one year or a major event in the company. Although it might not be mandatory, we recommend doing a <a href=""https://altshare.com/409a-valuation/"" id="""">409A valuation</a> every year, saving it, tracking it, and basing all grant-based compensation on it. </p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc9672f4c398aa_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%96%D7%9D-%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9-71-8.png,Article

Surprisingly (or not), the team's personal bond was found to be a significant benefactor to a company's success. The major statistics show that about 8 out of 10 startups fail within 18 months of their creation, the personal segment stars as one of the major acceleration forces.</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">So what should a funder do in order to create the best founders team? What to take into account? How to manage it? And last but definitely not least, how to create an equal yet efficient distribution of ownership? </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Remember the commonly repeated phrase that comes in every new commercial? “With three easy steps…” Well, this article will give you three important steps but be aware as they are not easy. Nonetheless, they must be made in order to build a perfect team that will set your startup on the way to success. Remember: everything is changeable and dynamic, from product to market but your founders' team will remain as you grow. </p><p id="""">Buckle up, we’re about to team up:</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Step One: Create your round table</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Any great startup starts with a dreamer and a dream, in order to get things going the right partners should be handpicked. The selection should be set in a way that everyone brings their own uniqueness to the table, but at the same time share the overall vision as you see it.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Paypal’s founder, <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Thiel"" id="""">Peter Thiel</a> describes in his book “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One"" id="""">Zero to One</a>” the most important aspects when looking for fellow owners. Most importantly, before any work-related concept, make sure you find people that enjoy spending time together. Only a cohesive co-founders team with a common interest and personal connection will stay stronger than any business-oriented dispute.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Theil probably knows what he’s talking about as the original PayPal team is known to this day as the “PayPal Mafia”. The entire team stayed in touch, helping each other prosper, and they all run highly successful companies such as Tesla, SpaceX, LinkedIn, Youtube, and Yelp.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Step Two: Manage your team effectively</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">You finally created a team made of the best and finest, now let’s try and answer the question that interested researchers for decades: what makes a team great? Google actually tried to answer that, in 2012 they created a special team called “<a href=""https://rework.withgoogle.com/print/guides/5721312655835136/"" id="""">The Aristotle Project</a>”. Although they had basically unlimited resources, and the world’s greatest Data pool, they struggled to give a direct answer. Eventually, the researchers created an experiment, they divided about 700 people into groups and asked them to accomplish assignments together. Two main patterns were noticed for the team that excelled: the first, all team members had a similar talk ratio compared to the other teammates. The second showed higher social intelligence per person than the less successful teams. They understood that the best quality to nurture in every team should be Psychological confidence, or in other words: a shared belief that any mistake can be made without judgment or punishment within the team.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">A study originated in <a href=""https://websummit.com/blog/tel-aviv-startup-ecosystem-city-guide-accelerator-funding-vc#:~:text=Israel%20ranks%20third%20in%20the,products%20and%20services%20every%20year."" id="""">Israel </a>(one of the top 10 ecosystems for startups worldwide) and shared with MIT and Mellon Carnegie, showed two major processes needed for a great team: specialty &amp; coordination. Specialty expresses each person’s unique input to the company, and coordination refers to one’s understanding of each person’s specialty and referring to them for a seamless flow. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Step three: Reverse cut the pie</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Finally, you found the perfect co-founders to run alongside you, this is the part you try thinking about how to divide the ownership of the company. Deciding who owns what stock-wise might seem like the right step, but unexpected events may always happen, and drift apart is always possible.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">It may happen that a partner that owns a decent amount of the company will leave before anything is going yet but will enjoy any future revenue as they still own a major part of the company.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Fortunately, there is a process made especially for this kind of partnership, and if you think about <a href=""https://altshare.com/knowitall/?whatarestockoptions?"" id="""">stock options</a>, get ready for a surprise. Stock options will commonly require an exercising price. More than that, the quantity of stock option that can be allocated to a single person are limited, so a true owner won't grow out of this. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">An intelligent road to take is a system called “Reverse Vesting”, which means the person will receive all of the stocks from day one but they will be subjected to his active role in the company. Essentially, if the co-founder chooses to leave the company, he will be obligated to deposit back a predetermined amount of the stocks given to him, at a set price (commonly without a price).</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Bonus - Step four: see the best scenario</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">You might be ready to start building your co-founders team and go as big as you can, one thing is important so you can keep everything in check, the books. Knowing what belongs to whom and how it affects every other investor and owner is important every step of the way. Your cap table isn’t for equity management only, it can help you create scenario models for every situation so you can calculate how to cut the pie between founders and what deals you are aiming for in each investment round. ‘</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">If you use a spreadsheet cap table the scenario modeling takes time and effort or money if you outsource it, but if you save your data in an <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/"" id="""">automated cap table</a>, go crazy! Create every scenario you can think of and make sure you have every angle calculated.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Furthermore, make sure to access a <a href=""https://altshare.com/data-room/"" id="""">designated data room</a> so you can save and revisit any contract, financial report, <a href=""https://altshare.com/409a-valuation/"" id="""">409A</a>, or anything that might be needed someday in <a href=""https://altshare.com/knowitall/"" id="""">due diligence</a> or a similar process. Planning for day one thousand should start at day one when you first get together with your new co-founders planning how to get there.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What’s your next step?</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Now you probably understand where you stand and what your next move is, so if you are just now trying to find good team members remember to find people you connect with personally. If you already have a team and are on your way to building them properly, try creating a safe space to make mistakes and highlight each person’s unique value. Create a smart and calculated equity division, and use every tool at your disposal to walk forward with the road as bright as possible. </p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc9680f0c397b5_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%96%D7%9D-%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9-71-4-4-3.png,Article

Here, you will discover who are the people that might ask for information from your cap table. Then, understand what they might ask and the reason behind the request.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Who’s asking?</strong></p><p id=""""><br>Typically, two major bodies of interest might ask for information from your cap table: Investors, and <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/audit-department.asp"" id="""">audit teams</a>. The investors have subsets with little difference yet specific requests. We divided the investors into<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venture_capital#:~:text=Venture%20capital%20firms%20or%20funds%20invest%20in%20these%20early%2Dstage,they%20support%20will%20become%20successful."" id=""""> VC (Venture Capital) firms</a> and <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privateequity.asp"" id="""">private investors</a>.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">What will they ask?</strong></p><p id="""">As the cap table, itself is considered classified by most companies and shouldn't be shared with anyone, the information it holds is being asked often. Most financial conclusions as well as some documentation can be subtracted from the cap table. Therefore, processes like due diligence, prospectus, and valuations will often require utilizing the cap table. What exactly will be asked? Here’s the answer:</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Investors</em><br>Investors tend to fund companies that they believe will show them profit eventually. This undisputed and obvious claim explains what an investor will look for in a company. Private investors commonly care about the bottom line, how will they be <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?Whatdodilutionsmean?"" id="""">diluted</a> at the end of the road? To answer this, there are two things to take into consideration: the past and the future. “The past” means what happened until now, and “the future” is what should be the dilution in case of some potential scenarios. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">If they are potential investors, it is crucial for them to know what piece of the pie will be theirs and what was promised to current investors. This information can be taken from the cap table directly, if you took notes from our last article “what should be on my cap table” or you use an <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/"" id="""">automated cap table</a> the information is available to you anytime, effortlessly. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">For Current and potential investors alike the what-if is significant in their daily decision-making process and <a href=""https://altshare.com/portfolio-management/"" id="""">portfolio management</a>. Knowing how they might be diluted and being able to plan ahead with a glimpse of the future is a reassurance that easily relaxes current investors and encourages potential ones to invest. To create <a href=""https://altshare.com/scenario-modeling/"" id="""">funding scenarios</a> with an updated spreadsheet cap table a professional is required and it might take a few weeks so take that into consideration. If you use Altshare’s automated cap table, these scenarios can be made seamlessly, with a click of a finger.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">VCs also look at the dilution section but the reason is somewhat different. Companies that invest in startups believe they know what turns a company into a success, so they make sure their voice can be heard and make a difference. How do they make sure it's certain their influence on the company's course remains? With enough seats on the board of directors of course. Before investing in a company, VCs make sure they can steer the company in the desired direction. Then, every time a <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?Whatisafundinground?"" id="""">funding round</a> occurs they look closely to make sure the dilutions don't weaken their voice and influence.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Audit Team</em><br>It goes without saying that an audit team doesn’t care about dilutions and control distribution in the company. What do they care about? That the process you are going through is filled with accurate details and all the information is clear. Any process has its own required information and extant but it's not up to you to provide any specific information. Despite its sensitivity, it is commonly required to hand your cap table “as is” to the audit team.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">If you use a spreadsheet cap table, make sure it is updated and no allocated options, RSUs, or investors have been neglected. For the automated users, Just export the cap table as a PDF to your digital data room and open access for the audit team.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Remember, an un-updated cap table will cause delays in any process you are trying to accomplish. If it’s a <a href=""https://altshare.com/409a-valuation/"" id="""">409A valuation,</a> for example, that delay will end with a headache from the constant back and forth. In a harsher scenario, if the process is due diligence for an investor, the issue might stop him from chipping in as it will cloud clearance on his anticipated dilution (and as we said, this is what investors are mostly interested in).</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion</strong><br>The cap table holds crucial information in a company so it is considered confidential. That being said, when interacting with investors and audit teams, they might ask for certain data or even the whole table. The data often asked can be easily found when the cap table is well updated and if intelligent scenario modeling has been done. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">This finalizes a three articles series to jump-start your cap table knowledge, first, we showed you the common options for a cap table administrator so you can choose your best fit. Then, we explained what should appear on the cap table and what better to put aside. Now, you know what information will be asked from your cap table and who might ask for it.

To the surprise of many, it can be managed through an automated SaaS and give more information than its old spreadsheet version. If you recently made the transformation or didn’t made the move yet, this article will summarize everything you should be able to do with this new cap table management tool.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">*important disclaimer: We are </strong><a href=""https://altshare.com/"" id=""""><strong id="""">Altshare</strong></a><strong id="""">, we offer a &nbsp;cap table management SaaS that has all the features shown here. that being said - this article is solely informative. We truly believe the future of cap table management should leave the Office (or Excel to be precise) and move to the digital future.</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><h4 id="""">Organized Past</h4><p id="""">Up until now, the cap table needed constant attendance, information regarding everyone’s shares could be extracted but it took an expert’s hard work in order to do so. Furthermore, most spreadsheet cap tables do not take into consideration the contractual rights and obligations of every investor, so the information that could be extracted was never complete.</p><p id="""">The automated cap table only asks you to list the information once, then it will keep track of the company’s ownership distribution, giving you access to the information 24/7. What does it mean? That you can have a firm grip of all company’s equity information at all times, and take calculated steps while you know exactly where you stand now and where you’re headed.</p><p id=""""> </p><h4 id="""">Seamless Present</h4><p id="""">The cap table in its old format used to hold a lot of information, relevant to creating many important reports - such as the <a href=""https://altshare.com/ASC-718/"" id="""">Stock-Based Compensation report</a>, the required <a href=""https://altshare.com/409a-valuation/"" id="""">409A</a> report for US-based employees, and many more. In spite of being a major information carrier, this format of cap table was far from a data pool and felt more like the data deep shark-infested sea. Yet again, in order to extract this information, you needed an expert, and even so, it took weeks for the best of their field.</p><p id="""">With the aid of the automated cap table, your reports can be issued with a click of a button. As every funder knows, there is nothing worse than letting important matters aside as you dwell on these small pesky inescapable things. Issuing important forms quickly and seamlessly, with a click of a finger, reduces the amount of effort invested on daily basis.</p><p id=""""> </p><h4 id="""">A Glimpse To The Future</h4><p id="""">We thought about calling this section “into the multiverse” but this concept is already taken. Though it is extremely accurate when it comes to visualizing any possible (or impossible) scenario for the company, and seeing what it actually means. The feature we are talking about is the Scenario Modeling tool, asking “what if” and getting a simple and direct answer. </p><p id="""">What scenarios should you run exactly? It’s completely up to you, let’s say you are just getting ready to do your seed round. A major investor has opened his schedule for you but not his wallet (yet), you already gathered some money through an FFF round but it’s merely enough to get things going. While getting ready for this life-changing meeting, it’s time you run some scenarios, input a Funding scenario to all kinds of investments that might result in this meeting. Now you can understand - what will be the expected company’s value, what should be the expected dilution for each stock owner, and what other investors’ privileges will be set to motion (such as a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_agreement_for_future_equity"" id="""">SAFE</a> conversion into stock for example).</p><p id="""">This scenario creation was technically possible via spreadsheet cap table but it was almost never put to use. The reason is that it took weeks to gather and calculate the needed information in order to create a single scenario, consisting of many variations such as: company value, actual investment, current investor’s privileges, and the new ones. So creating funding scenarios that will cover all possible outcomes was considered to be impossible, which might be the most significant effect of the transformation to the automated digital cap table.</p><p id=""""> </p><h4 id="""">Conclusion</h4><p id="""">The shift from a spreadsheet-based cap table to a digital automated one is a game-changer, not only in the field of equity management and recording, but also with the creation of many reports, and most importantly a scenarios input for any future change in the company, as complicated or far ahead as it is. Two people with a laptop, currently starting their startup can now seamlessly, freely, imagine how will their company look in the far future, right before an investment, or at their final destination - an exit.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc968059c398a8_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%96%D7%9D-%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9-71-1-1.png,Article

Many people, including professional CFOs, tend to fill it with overly complicated information and neglect critical data. The reason might lay in a misunderstanding of the cap table's job and its significant effect on future valuations, inspections, and potential investors.</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">This article will shed a light on the proper way to set the table. Here you will find a summary of its job and reason to exist, an explanation of what should appear in the cap table, as well as information that isn’t relevant and might overcomplicate things. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Step one - Setting up the cap table</strong></p><p id="""">For most founders this should be a step one in general, not only financially wise, setting up a cap table is the way to keep track of the equity to its core. So as soon as there is more than one holder in the company, the shares are distributed and should be recorded in a designated system - AKA the cap table.</p><p id="""">There are two ways to create a cap table: the classic spreadsheet, and the intelligent automated. Like the Walkman, although groundbreaking in its era, the spreadsheet cap table is a classic that belongs to the history channel and hardly to the startup nation. The strongest notion of this claim is the fact that most of the important information should be asked when you add the data to an <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/"" id="""">automated cap table</a>. No need to remember anything, just make sure to upload all the necessary information, and you’re done.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">What is the necessary information? Here’s the full list:</p><ul id=""""><li id=""""><strong id="""">Date of Allocation</strong> - including year</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Amount </strong>- keep all amounts recorded in the percentage out of the total</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Classification </strong>- common/preferred, don't forget</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Round </strong>- what funding round each <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shareholder.asp#:~:text=our%20editorial%20policies-,What%20Is%20a%20Shareholder%3F,benefits%20of%20a%20business's%20success."" id="""">shareholder </a>joined</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Liquidation preferences</strong> - what special preferences shareholders have that aren’t lined with their funding round</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Warrants </strong>- Amount, stock layer name, and classification</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Allocated Options </strong>- Basic data only</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Unallocated Options </strong>- Basic data only</li><li id=""""><strong id="""">Exercised Options </strong>- Basic data only</li></ul><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Step Two - Too Much Information<br></strong>Remember that this cap table should make order in the equity chaos? So there is a thing called too much information, and here, this is the name of the game. <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?Whatarestockoptions?"" id="""">Stock options</a> are a great example, the data is important and critical to understanding the flow of the company's future equity. Although important, this information might make the cap table unnecessarily complicated, and excessive. The golden options triangle consists of three important variables:<br>1. <a href=""https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/unallocated-stock-options#:~:text=Unallocated%20Stock%20Options%20means%20all,or%20issued%20to%20any%20Equity"" id="""">Unallocated options<br></a>2.<a href=""https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/option-allocation#:~:text=Option%20Allocation%20means%20the%20product,Time%20excluding%20the%20New%20Options."" id=""""> Allocated options<br></a>3.<a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?Whatisexercisingastockoption?"" id=""""> Exercised options</a></p><p id="""">As a final note, add a calculation of all this three to see the options pool number, this is important in order to understand how the shares are being distributed when everyone is <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?Whatdoesfullydilutedmean?"" id="""">fully diluted</a>.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">This tip has a side note next to it, we always give advice upon our own experience, so for those using Altshare’s automated cap table, you will notice information regarding stock options is being asked for running the cap table. The reason is that the system keeps track of all the information behind the stage and updates the cape table accordingly, so the basic information is presented in the actual table but all the data is stored, tracked, and updated when it should affect the cap table.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">That being said, one thing needs a human eye from time to time no matter what: data correlations. Make sure the information embedded in the cap table is updated to the recently signed contracts, set regulations, and preferences. Some updates occur so rarely that people often forget to update the cap table, a simple yet crucial thing to do. A wrongly set cap table with false information regarding these qualities might create a huge setback for future valuations and due diligence.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Furthermore, some, tend to add to the cap table results of scenarios they've done, as well as share distribution plans, and theoretical warrants. Those kinds of irrelevant information might derail an investment opportunity as it will create a false picture of the dilution for each investor and might prevent one from investing.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Step Three - Keeping track</strong></p><p id="""">Once everything is set, a lot of data will be gathered every now and then, this information should be kept and updated and field out of the cap table. Major changes in the cap table are a good example, the old cap table needs to be stored for future valuations and due diligence. If you use an automated cap table, just download a PDF with the older version and keep going. As it’s possible to just view older versions with a click of a finger, we do suggest saving the older cap tables in a dedicated file, or in a <a href=""https://altshare.com/data-room/"" id="""">digital data room</a> to make your life even easier. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">A digital data room is a place to keep all the papers, documents, contracts, and any information you deemed worthy in one organized hub. It is possible dedicating the information you want to keep to a data room and give access only to those you want any specific data. It is a great way to keep the cap table lean and precise yet file any information desired.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Final notes </strong></p><p id="""">Although you are now set to a wonderful start, keeping everything in check is completely up to you. Updating the data in a cap table will not occur so often, the only thing that changes frequently is the stock options section so consider that with every beginning of a workday, or week. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">If you're done reading the first chapter in this article series, you already know who should run your cap table. now, no matter who that is, you know what should be in it and how it is supposed to look. Us your well-constructed cap table to move you forward, now you can easily make sense of your equity game, and be hands-on when facing investors, star employees, or an audit team. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">To continue your journey in becoming a cap table master, read our next article in this series: “Who’s going to ask for my cap table?”</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc969d6dc39702_New-Project-2022-05-02T153445.453.png,Article
How To Aim Globally And Hit,how-to-aim-globally-and-hit,642adfbf50fc9661adc39701,642adfbf50fc967d54c39767,Thu Dec 15 2022 03:40:14 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Dec 15 2022 04:03:04 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Dec 15 2022 04:03:17 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Important aspects for companies thinking: how to aim globally and hit the mark?,"<p id=""""><strong id="""">Up until a few years ago, companies with a global orientation didn’t start by aiming globally at the beginning. First, they launched the product in their country of origin, created a beta, and improved it until they felt ready to move forward. Only then, they paved the path by trial and error to other countries until eventually, the company became global. </strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Today, we witness a different approach: aiming globally from day one. although this method is significantly quicker in achieving a global appearance, it has a greater risk of failure. As the global market shows instability and it is becoming challenging to find investors, founders try to come by faster, less costly, and more efficient ways to grow globally. This article will highlight the often neglected financial aspects to remember while starting small and aiming globally.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Go Online<br></strong>Paper hasn't forgotten its roots and like the trees, it isn't especially mobile. For most problems, there is a digital solution so try and find a way to digitalize any process you can. Working via <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service"" id="""">SaaS</a> will help the company to stay agile, change its base, or open new branches with ease.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">On top of that, digitalizing the company’s process and the database will help keep the information accessible even after years go by. From our experience, documentation such as grant letters, valuation reports, and <a href=""https://altshare.com/ASC-718/"" id="""">tax reports</a> are often forgotten in an unobtainable hard copy and will be a hustle to come by if they're needed (and they probably will be).</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Be prepared<br></strong>Getting properly ready is the most important feat, only after everything is in order, entering a local, global, or any market can be smooth. As <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln"" id="""">Abrahan Lincoln</a> put it: “Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe”. Being prepared means making sure you can properly handle things that in all likelihood will come in the future, a <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/"" id="""">409A valuation</a> for example.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">409A valuation is a must for any company intending to allocate stock options to its American employees. Although some investors ask for it in a due diligence process, if you are not based in the USA or intend to employ Americans, a 409A is probably not a must right now. That being said, if one day you will have to go through one, odds are, you will need a report for each year that has gone without a <a href=""https://altshare.com/409a-valuation/"" id="""">409A valuation</a>. When this common scenario might occur, a badly kept cap table might create a headache like no other and will be a struggle to get out of (more on that up ahead).</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">An Anti-Headache Cap</strong></p><p id="""">A <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/"" id="""">capitalization table</a> (cap table) is commonly created when the company is no more than two founders with a laptop and should be kept meticulously from that moment forward. The cap table is the company's database regarding every shareholder and equity distribution. Therefore, it is essential not only for a 409A valuation but for any equity-related matter. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">In the beginning, it has no more than a few rows, but as time goes by, investors join, stock options are allocated, vested, and sold, the cap table will change often. Most successful companies and accounting firms use an <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/"" id="""">automated cap table</a> to max the efficacy and avoid human error. A decent automated cap table should keep track of the frequent changes regularly and update the information automatically. If for some reason you decided to go with the old spreadsheet, be prepared to update the information and go through the data constantly or face future consequences.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Unlike most companies, Altshare offers <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/"" id="""">free automated cap table</a> management, so utilizing this incredible tool comes with zero cost. Furthermore, a unique feature called Funding Scenario was recently added to the Altshare SaaS (Jul 2022). Now founders can better plan by visualizing all scenarios imaginable with a single click and stay prepared for any vesting opportunity.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Fill and File</strong></p><p id="""">Paperwork tends to pile up, some companies invest in the intelligent thing and digitalize it all. Although the files are now digital, it is still an issue to send and share documents securely worldwide. Fortunately, a dedicated data room was made to solve this problem exactly, &nbsp;it is a designated space made for sensitive documents. It especially comes in handy when something from the first years is requested by an investor or an audit team and needs to be dug up.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><a href=""https://altshare.com/data-room/"" id="""">Data rooms</a> oriented to this field, are made to keep financial information so they are considered highly secured. Some platforms even offer compartmentalization between the recipients themselves. To be able to file everything online, and share it globally, combined with an ability to decide who sees what and how is an ace in the hole for any globally inspiring company.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion</strong><br>When considering the concept of a global company it is important to digitalize whatever is possible and work via SaaS platforms to allow access from anywhere. Even after digitalizing everything, it is crucial to stay organized and prepare for any scenario. By keeping a meticulous cap table or by working with an automated one, preparation becomes smoother and more officiant.

409A VS Post-money Valuation,409a-vs-post-money-valuation,642adfbf50fc9661adc39701,642adfbf50fc96a0e0c3977c,Thu Dec 15 2022 03:41:04 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Dec 15 2022 04:03:04 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Thu Dec 15 2022 04:03:17 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Discover why there is a difference between the 409A valuation to a Post money valuation,"<p id="""">Did you find a difference between the company’s fair market value within the <a href=""https://altshare.com/409a-valuation/"" id="""">409A valuations</a> and the post-money equity valuation? It is more common than you might think. Often, companies will face a major gap between the two valuations and there is a good reason behind it. This mini-article will show you how each valuation concludes its findings and why the difference often happens.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Post-money valuation</strong><br>Because its main purpose is fundraising, it does not require any particular complex calculation method and founders can come up with the numbers by themselves. More than that, this valuation can be used as a negotiation tool and reflects the founders' belief in the company but not necessarily the reality.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">To calculate the post-money valuation, use this formula: Investment amount ÷ what the investor receives (in %). For example, an investment amount of 1M with an offer of 10% shares to the investor will result in a post-money valuation of 100K (1M ÷ 10).</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">409A Valuation</strong><br>This very precise process is mostly based on data and doesn’t take into consideration the market trends and expected growth. Mainly performed by a <a href=""https://altshare.com/"" id="""">trusted professional</a>, coming by a 409A valuation requires the use of a complex calculation method. In the case of a <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp#toc-what-is-an-initial-public-offering-ipo"" id="""">deal</a> concluded in the past six months prior to the valuation, the calculation will be done in a method called Backsolve (on most occasions).</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The difference</strong><br>You probably figured up until now why the difference exists. But if not, here is the simplified explanation: both contain different calculating methods and variables. The post-money valuation does not include any share preferences, discounts, or other benefits shareholders hold. A 409A valuation, on the other hand, contains cold data alone, without growth expectations, market trends, and so on.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc96f8c4c397fa_trail6.png,Mini Article

As time passed, we all understood how effective and beneficial remote employment is, and today it is an inseparable part of the high-tech ecosystem. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">The second quality that is also vastly practiced within high-tech companies is allocating<a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?Whatarestockoptions?"" id=""""> stock options</a>. The founder creates a strong bond between the employees and the company by giving them a fraction of ownership. At the same time, he’s not being forced to give immediate cash as compensation so it is considered to be a win-win strategy.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Companies today try to integrate the two and offer well-structured <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockcompensation.asp"" id="""">stock-based compensation plan</a>s to remotely-based employees. Even so, some things may change or vary between countries or states and the process might be a bit different. This article will lighten the runway for founders planning to allocate stock options to employees working remotely.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">To err is human</strong><br>The first step in allocating overseas or remotely is to reduce human error to the minimum, it starts with managing your cap table properly. Long long ago in a time forgotten, people relayed solely on excel tables to make sure everything is well updated. Inevitably, the Sum is no longer higher in the chain of command when it comes to cap table management.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">An <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/"" id="""">automated cape table</a> is considered to be the best solution in equity management, and it seamlessly allows keeping the often-updated stock options data in check. By reducing human interaction within the cap table, running a multi-continent stock-based compensation plan can become significantly simpler.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Furthermore, and presumably most importantly, in some countries, the cap table is used as a baseline for many important reports and valuations. By keeping an automated cap table, issuing these reports and applying valuations on demand become effortless as it is reduced to a few clicks of a mouse. One of the more common cap table based valuations is the <a href=""https://altshare.com/409a-valuation/"" id="""">409A valuation</a>.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">When in Rome<br></strong>There are countries that have specific laws and regulations regarding stock-based compensation plans given to their citizens. In some cases, not following these regulations can cause heavy taxation that the employee will have to pay, like in Israel for example. The Israeli government wanted to encourage start-ups so they issued a <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?Whatissection102oftheIsraelitaxordinance?"" id="""">section to the Income Tax Ordinance called 102</a>.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">The 102 section dictates that a person given stock options will be able to sell them and pay up to 25% tax (instead of a maximum of about 60%). One of the regulations under that section obligates the company to run its option via a trustee, skipping this obligation or failing to follow the other regulations, will cause the employee to pay an unnecessarily high tax. Imagine, wanting to encourage your employees but failing to follow the regulations and creating an unhappy, and frustrated team.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">In other cases, it is simply impossible to allocate stock options without following specific laws, like in the case of the United States and the <a href=""https://altshare.com/resources-cat/the-411-on-the-409a-valuation/"" id="""">409A valuation</a>. When tending to allocate any stock-based compensation in the US, the exercise price has to comply with the common share price of the company. To calculate the common share price within the US regulations, a 409A valuation has to be made and applied to the IRS. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">It's important to know that the 409A valuation has an expiration date of exactly 1 year but it's crucial to understand that there is another reason for it to expire. A 409A valuation will expire if a major event with financial implications occurs in the company. It means that a 409A might need a redo after a few months, so it is highly recommended to give it extra attention. </p><p id="""">Unlike the Israeli 102 that failing to follow it will have taxation implications, the 409A valuation is a must if you desire to employ Americans. Allocating stock options to American employees without the common stock price from a 409A is illegal and you will probably hit a brick wall if you try to go around it. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Where do I sign?</strong><br>We often recommend using a <a href=""https://altshare.com/data-room/"" id="""">digital data room</a> to keep all the documentation in order, and to create effective compartmentalization. In this case, the data room feat is not only a “nice to have”, it’s a must. A dedicated data room that is secure enough for all the sensitive information can save thousands of time and money. Trying to send, receive, or apprehend important documents such as grant letters, contracts, and board signatures will turn from a hustle to a simple task.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">One of the biggest challenges of employing people that aren't close by is finishing processes that required their signature or interaction. When it comes to finalizing confidential documents companies used to bring the employee all the way to headquarters. As the employee sometimes don’t work in the same country, this task was costly and time-consuming. With a well-structured data room that has all the security and protection required, all these processes are reduced to a link and click.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The big three - conclusion<br></strong>Now you can start the process of allocating stock options to employees working remotely with ease. Just remember these three important tips: </p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Try and automate all the pesky processes you can, and most importantly your cap table.</li><li id="""">Make sure you understand all the laws and regulations of each country you interact with its citizens.</li><li id="""">Utilize the power of a dedicated data room to minimize time and funds, finishing or signing any confidential documentation.</li></ol>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc967a3dc39722_Article-15.08.png,Article

Although this situation might be a bit frightening, nothing is lost yet and some things can be done to try and climb the economic rock bottom. Before considering the drastic make sure you know what your options are, this article will explain the more commonly used methods and how they should be addressed.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The FEE triangle</strong><br>There is a special connection between the entrepreneur, the employees on one hand, and the founders on the other. Unfortunately, most equity solutions, in this case, are considered an “<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_trinity"" id="""">Impossible Trinity</a>” - no more than two can benefit from any given solution. Although we will show you each alternative, it is up to you to decide which is the right path for your company.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">That being said, it is a commonly agreeable concept to try and keep the employees happy. Most will consider them as the yellow brick road to success: when the employees are happy they will work harder to make the customers happy. Then, the company will grow so all investors will be satisfied, and finally, the founders could enjoy the ripe fruits. For this reason, it is important to take the allocated stock options under consideration when thinking of the best solution for any equity conundrum. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Better SAFE than sorry</strong><br>This “Simple Agreement for Future Equity” was originally created as a replacement for convertible notes by the lawyer <a href=""https://golden.com/wiki/Carolynn_Levy-63AWD4V"" id="""">Carolynn Levy</a>. It shows a solution both the investor and the founder can benefit from: the investor will fund a company and receive shares by an amount set in a future, predetermined event. This negates the arbitrary characteristics that a funding round usually has, as it bases the transaction on a precise valuation yet to come.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">In a SAFE, the founder will enjoy a cash flow that isn’t affected by the company's current low state. The investor, on the other hand, can get involved in a scaling company just before it rises and enjoys a high potential profit. That being said, a SAFE also affects heavily the shareholders' dilution and the amount they will be diluted will only be discovered up ahead.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">The reason SAFE has become very popular in the past few years relates hardly to the global epidemic. An <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp"" id="""">IPO</a> can go live without losing value if the investments went through a safe. Furthermore, founders can receive a cash flow adjusted to what they believe the company can be and not what it is right now. </p><p id="""">Nonetheless, keep in mind that leaving your current investors in the dark on their expected dilution might not be the best move for some. We highly suggest advising your CFO or accountant on the best way to accomplish this tricky yet efficient feat.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">The scenario modeling here is even of greater importance, not as uncommon as you might think, companies tend to receive a higher than anticipated funding amount. Sounds like a dream comes true? Well, it is more of a nightmare, too much is a thing, and failing to handle the amount and consider every aspect can harm more than it can do good. Know what is the range of cash you need, not only the minimum, the maximum as well.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Sometimes down is up</strong><br>One of the most commonly used methods is a down round. This doesn't require any particular preparation so founders often choose this path without understanding its full consequences. It means going for another funding round at a lower company value, deriving a lower PPS (price per share) than the previous round. For a company that is sunk in the mud and in need of a serious strong pull, this might be a good solution.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Right before you decide to take your company through a down round there are two important things to remember:</p><ol id=""""><li id="""">Imagination is the best practice - theoretically, you can go to a funding round and at first try to convince new investors that they should invest at the same price as your previous round. That way you can try and avoid the actual down round, only if it doesn't work, ask for lower funds per share.<br>This is the reason most try to avoid going through any stock valuation so there will not be a price tag they can’t go around.</li><li id="""">Is dilution the solution? - remember that in this case, no matter the share amount or value you offer, it will dilute all shareholders*, including you and your current investors. To understand exactly how every shareholder will be diluted and to wisely plan ahead use <a href=""https://altshare.com/scenario-modeling/"" id="""">scenario modeling</a>. By modeling this round you can understand what your limitations are, see what can be bent, and how low you can really go. If you use <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/"" id="""">Althsare’s automated cap table</a> it shouldn't be harder than a click of a finger.</li></ol><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">*Sometimes, to prevent dilution, investors will receive an update on their holdings so they won't be affected by the down round.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Will you share a share?</strong><br>This method is called Venture Debt Financing and it is feared by some and adored by others. Simply put, it's a loan given by a bank or a venture capital, yet because of its risk the VC includes warrants in the pricing, and the interest is often high.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Like any other loan, you pay the debt with significant interest and essentially pay a lot more than you gained. The sweeter part of the deal is that there’s no dilution, at all, you get cash and keep the company at its current shareholders' state (excluding any exercised stock options).</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Some VCs also offer <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/recurringrevenue.asp"" id="""">ARR and MRR loans</a>, it is commonly offered to SaaS companies as it offers a monthly or yearly fund. The amount is calculated by the anticipated revenue from the company's growth and current users. As it is calculated from a linear perspective, and most companies grow exponentially it is considered highly attractive to SaaS founders. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion</strong><br>Although sometimes things look a bit low, as the “the hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy” put it: “Don’t Panic”. There are routes to consider and a financial path that might lead you to a safe haven. In most of our articles, we offer you to decide on the path that suit you most, here we offer to take each careful step with the aid of a professional. As we showed the most popular options and you now know more than before, there are other alternatives and things to consider.

Although it’s unpleasant to see your company losing some of its value, you probably still have faith and believe things will get better. The challenge is, how to harness your employees to the same belief?</strong></p><p id="""">This article will give you all the practical solutions to keep them invested in the company regarding the stock options offered to them. Ready? Let's dive in.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">*important note: </strong>there is a difference between handling underwater options in a<a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/privatecompany.asp"" id=""""> private company</a> to a <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/publiccompany.asp"" id="""">public one</a>. In most cases, the employee is well aware of the stock price of a public company but in a private one, the valuation might come only once in a while so the information might not be as available. This fact gives the founder a lot of responsibility towards his employees in a private company as he might be more aware of the company’s financial status.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The capillary waves</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Just like a single water drop can send waves to alter the entire pool, a company’s drop in value will have a direct effect on its stock price and therefore the attractivity of the offered <a href=""https://altshare.com/knowitall/?whatarestockoptions?"" id="""">stock options</a>. If for example, the <a href=""https://altshare.com/knowitall/?whatisexercisingastockoption?"" id="""">exercise</a> price for a stock option was granted at $10 and the stock is now estimated at $7, this so-called benefit is now not only worthless, it is actually more expensive for an employee to buy a stock than any other person. Underwater options are common but nonetheless problematic, as they demolish the employee's spirit and commitment to the company’s success.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Keep their head above water</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Fortunately, there are several methods to take for keeping this grant-based compensation attractive and with it, ensuring the commitment of the employees. We organized the methods from the most used to the rarest, although picking the suitable one for your company is completely up to you.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Lower the current</em></p><p id=""""><em id=""""><br></em>This option is known as Repricing, it describes a change in the exercise price in each grant letter to fit the new <a href=""https://altshare.com/knowitall/?whatarecommonstocks?"" id="""">common stock</a> price. Repricing is a good fit for companies that believe the change in value will stay for a while, it’s not like giving up to the current state and more of a calculated next step for the near future.</p><p id="""">Adjusting the exercise price is a good way to let your employees stay connected and give them an extra push to re-establish the company's formal value and to go further. Just keep in mind that repricing is a form of Modification and therefore should be addressed on the expansion report for the yearly financial report.</p><p id="""">Repricing means to reopen every grant letter, change, and resign it so for larger companies this process might take a while. Remember, keeping track of these changes is crucial as well as updating all this information in your cap table, the old grant letters should be kept as well but with a noticeable remark that they are void.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Change the flow</em></p><p id=""""><em id=""""><br></em>Some funders prefer to make a change in the grant letter conditions as it sends the message that they believe the company’s value will rise, but nonetheless, the employees haven't gone unnoticed. A change in conditions can expedite the vesting period, redefine its vesting condition, or even increase the number of allocated options. These changes also go under modification and therefore affect the expensing report and should be addressed in it.</p><p id="""">Similar to repricing, a change in grant conditions requires a rewriting and signing of every grant letter in the company. keep in mind that a change in the vesting condition, such as a move from a <a href=""https://altshare.com/resources-cat/what-are-your-options/"" id="""">grant by performance</a> to a grant by service, can have an impact on the employee spirit as each sends a different message. Make sure to openly explain the changes and how it is done to benefit the employee so nothing will not fall in the translation of the situation.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Just float</em></p><p id=""""><em id=""""><br></em>Can doing nothing be actually doing something? in this situation surprisingly yes. Well although some actions need to be taken, financially and stock options-wise, you don’t have to make any changes. Sometimes, a decrease in a company’s value can be short-termed or affected by an event that should end soon enough, therefore keeping everything as it is should be a valid option.</p><p id="""">In this covid-19 couple of years, some startups might have suffered a significant downfall, they might believe this situation won’t last forever. An expected growth should start rebuilding as soon as things get back to normal. This example shows a good reason why some founders don’t want to make any changes and keep everything as it is, that being said one thing is crucial when making the decision to hold any changes - clarity.</p><p id="""">Make sure to stay perfectly clear with your employees, explain the reason for the value dropdown and why you think it shouldn't impact in the long term. Here, keeping your employees in check is all about how often you speak to them and what you say exactly. As they don’t see any changes done to their benefits, they might get discouraged easily and should be given often pep talks and motivation starters.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><em id="""">Sail differently</em></p><p id=""""><em id=""""><br></em>Although used on rare occasions, it is possible to change the grant method from stock options to Restricted Stock Units (RSUs). Unlike stock options, RSUs come without any basic cost, so they are technically actual stocks to be issued in the future. This grant method negates any effect of the stock price and therefore helps encourage employees to invest in the company without any applications to their own money.</p><p id="""">Offering RSUs is a big deal so make sure to carefully consider the meaning of letting employees enjoy free (+tax) stocks. As it might be a huge morale booster, this opportunity will let many people have partial ownership in the company, and in cases where there are many employees, it can delay the company's increase in value (as the options are given for “free”). </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion</strong></p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Underwater options accrue when a companies share value drops below the exercising price offered to employees in their grant letter. There are multiple ways to address the matter in order to keep the benefits and morale with your employees. Because each method might suit a variety of founders with different kinds of companies or situations, we suggest choosing a method that is aligned with your point of view, to give you a better good night-sleep and hand your subordinates a vision you can both share.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc960d89c39829_%D7%9E%D7%99%D7%96%D7%9D-%D7%97%D7%93%D7%A9-71-11.png,Article

Unlike most of the information there, the stock options data changes on a regular basis and needs constant updates to stay relevant and correct. This article will shed light and help you understand how to make it as precise as possible.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Does it matter?</strong></p><p id="""">This pesky task of updating the options part of the cap table might be small but keep in mind there's a good reason it's there. For small to medium companies, there might not be many employees with <a href=""https://altshare.com/Equity-Glossary/?whatarestockoptions%3F=&utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=Is+Your+Cap+Table+Updated%3F+-+stock+options"" id="""">allocated stock options</a> but as the company grows this section will increase in volume. As you might have heard, size is not everything but a neglected cap table sends a problematic message to potential investors. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">As we are about to finish 2022 it is becoming clearer that the market is not at its best, investors tend to hold their money close to their chest and founders struggle to raise funds. Trying to <a href=""https://altshare.com/resources-cat/show-any-investor-or-angel-you-mean-business/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=Is+Your+Cap+Table+Updated%3F+-+avoid+dealbreakers"" id="""">avoid dealbreakers</a> as much as possible is now crucial and founders go out of their way to wow and seal the deal. Showing a potential investor that you don’t know exactly how the <a href=""https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/corporate-capital.asp#:~:text=Corporate%20capital%20includes%20any%20assets,up%20a%20company's%20corporate%20capital."" id="""">company's capital</a> is divided might send an amateurish vibe and put a spoke in your wheel.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">The ins and outs</strong></p><p id="""">A well-constructed cap table consists of updated, relevant information about the entire shareholders base. The problem is that options holders aren't shareholders just yet, we do not neglect them from the cap table yet they appear altogether. The option holders define only people that hold vested stock options, which means only after the options are ready to be purchased do we add them to that section in the cap table.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">To keep the options section in the cap table fully updated this is the information you should require on daily basis:</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Newly vested options - add the amount and data about people that have stock options that are just now allocated.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Expired options - after a person parts ways with a company, he receives a grace period in which he can still exercise his vested options. The grace period is commonly 90 days, after that time has passed, his options return to the pool and should be deleted from the cap table.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Exercised options - when a person pays the set amount and exercises his options, he becomes a shareholder. Here there are two approaches, some, remove the exercised amount from the options pool and add the person to the cap table as an individual name. Others prefer to summarize those small shareholders into one line, they are removed from the calculation of the option but added to an identical line regarding exercised option. The bottom line here is no matter how you state it in the cap table, just don’t forget to remove the data from the options line.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Spreadsheet vs automated cap table</strong></p><p id="""">The two preferred ways to run a cap table today are via spreadsheet or with an <a href=""https://altshare.com/cap-table/?utm_source=Website&utm_medium=Blog&utm_campaign=Is+Your+Cap+Table+Updated%3F+-+automated+cap+table"" id="""">automated platform</a>. The question is, is there any difference between these two ways regarding the stock options section? The short answer is yes. And here’s why:</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">When people say spreadsheet they often refer to an Excel sheet so we will treat it as such. Creating a cap table vs Excel is highly effective because of the variety of computation capabilities, graphing tools, and pivot tables. The problem is the constant updates required to keep the data relevant. Any change should be reported manually to reduce the gaps that might grow when the cap table is not updated regularly. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Furthermore, if there is no strict method for applying the data, there's also a decent chance of confusion between people updating and different versions. If you prefer to work on a spreadsheet, we recommend giving google sheets a chance as it consists of one shareable file.</p><p id=""""> </p><p id="""">Although effective, the spreadsheet is not the best solution, Running your cap table via an automated platform can keep the data fully updated without you needing to deal with it every day. An automated cap table will require uploading new data once and because the employees also have their dedicated platform, everything stays updated. This tiny time thief named options segment can run on its own and won't need constant care and attention. </p><p id=""""> </p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Conclusion</strong></p><p id="""">The line in the cap table referring to stock options is small but might create a butterfly effect with a high impact on a company. We recommended giving it attention and making sure it’s updated. The three most important events to give attention to are newly vested options, expired options, and exercised options. If you prefer using a spreadsheet we suggest trying google sheets yet we believe an automated cap table is a right step toward the future of cap table management and a precise stock options segment.</p><p>‍</p>",https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/642adfbf50fc967a16c396d2/642adfbf50fc965b21c398a6_Article-05.12-2-1.png,Article
